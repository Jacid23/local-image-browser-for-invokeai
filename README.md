- Cloud Sync: Optional cloud backup and sync
- Plugin System: Extensible architecture for custom parsers

## Quick Start

1. **Select Folder**: Click "Change Folder" and select your InvokeAI outputs directory
2. **Wait for Indexing**: First-time indexing takes a few minutes (cached afterwards)
3. **Browse & Select**: Use Ctrl+click to select multiple images like Windows Explorer
4. **Search & Filter**: Use the search bar and filters to find specific images
5. **Manage Files**: Rename, delete, or export metadata for selected images
6. **View Details**: Click any image to see full metadata and larger preview

## Usage Tips

- **First Load**: Initial indexing of large collections (17k+ images) takes 3-4 minutes
- **Subsequent Loads**: Cached data loads in ~10 seconds
- **New Images**: Only new images are processed, maintaining fast performance
- **Multi-Selection**: Use Ctrl+click to select multiple images for bulk operations
- **File Management**: Rename and delete operations available in desktop app only
- **Search**: Use word-boundary search (e.g., "city" won't match "opacity")
- **Thumbnails**: Place your InvokeAI thumbnails directory alongside images for faster loading
- **Export Metadata**: Click any image to open details and use export dropdown for TXT/JSON files
- **Filtering**: Combine multiple filters (model + LoRA + scheduler) for precise searches

## Technical Architecture

Built with modern web technologies for optimal performance:

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript 5.2
- **Desktop**: Electron 38 with auto-updater
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.0
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for persistent caching
- **File Access**: File System Access API + Electron File System
- **IPC**: Secure inter-process communication for file operations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (responsive design)

- **Settings Persistence**: Sort preferences and pagination settings are saved automatically
- **Dark Theme**: Eye-friendly dark interface optimized for long browsing sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Privacy & Security

**Complete Local Processing - Zero Data Collection:**

- **100% Local Execution**: All image processing, metadata extraction, and caching happens entirely within your browser
- **No Network Requests**: The application never sends any data to external servers or services
- **No Telemetry**: No usage analytics, tracking pixels, or data collection of any kind
- **No User Accounts**: No registration, login, or personal information required
- **Offline Capable**: Works completely offline after initial page load
- **Browser-Only Storage**: All data (cache, settings, thumbnails) stored locally using browser APIs (IndexedDB, localStorage)
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: Does not rely on any cloud services or external APIs
- **File System Permissions**: Uses browser's File System Access API with explicit user permission for each directory access
- **Your Data Stays Yours**: Images, metadata, prompts, and all generated data never leave your device

**Technical Privacy Implementation:**
- **IndexedDB**: Local database storage for caching (never synchronized)
- **File System Access API**: Direct local file access without file uploads
- **PNG Metadata Parsing**: Client-side metadata extraction from image files
- **No External CDNs**: All dependencies bundled locally (except Tailwind CSS from CDN for styling only)

This tool is designed for users who prioritize data privacy and want complete control over their AI-generated image collections.

## Browser Compatibility

This application requires a modern browser that supports the File System Access API:

- **Chrome 86+** - Fully supported
- **Edge 86+** - Fully supported  
- **Firefox** - Not yet supported (API not implemented)
- **Safari** - Not yet supported (API not implemented)

## Technical Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building  
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **File System Access API** for local file browsing
- **IndexedDB** for intelligent caching
- **PNG Metadata Parsing** for InvokeAI metadata extraction

## Performance Benchmarks

Tested and optimized for large collections:

- **17,559+ images** processed successfully
- **5,500+ images/minute** processing speed
- **3-4 minutes** initial scan for 18k images
- **~10 seconds** subsequent loads with cache
- **Memory efficient** with lazy loading and pagination
- **Thumbnail optimization** using InvokeAI's .webp cache
- **Smart filtering** excludes intermediate/temporary images automatically

## Search Features

**Precise Search Functionality:**
- **Word Boundary Matching**: Searches for complete words only (searching "city" won't match "opacity")
- **Case Insensitive**: Matches regardless of capitalization
- **Metadata Search**: Searches through all PNG metadata including prompts, model names, and generation settings
- **Real-time Results**: Instant filtering as you type
- **Combined Filtering**: Search terms work alongside model and LoRA filters
